## Vision
> We develop, use, share and teach and share, innovative applied open data science and modelling methods to help NHS healthcare providers deliver higher quality healthcare to more patients.

## Strategy

We do this by:

* Focussing our work on that which helps NHS healthcare providers deliver higher quality healthcare to more patients.
* Disseminating innovative, and published, research into open data science and modelling methods.
* Developing our Open Science processes and infrastructure (including a secure research environment).
Making our models available to NHS users as Web Apps, and teaching and supporting those in the NHS to do the same.
Developing capacity within the NHS to use open data science and modelling methods.
Training the next generation of scientists to apply open data science and modelling methods to help NHS healthcare providers.
Collaboratingon with others committed to, or with a desire to learn, open data science and modelling methods.
Attracting people wishing to develop open data science and modelling methods to help NHS healthcare providers.
Promoting the adoption of open modelling and data science in both health services research and healthcare providers.
Working closely with patient representatives, and promoting involvement of patients in research via our teaching activities.
