### HSMA

The Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme is a training and mentoring programme that supports staff working in health, social care and policing organisations in England to learn and apply practical skills in operational modelling and data science. Staff are released from their usual role for a day a week for 15 months. They receive six months of training in open modelling and data science skills, as well as training in programming in Python from first principles. They are then supported by a community of HSMA trainers, researchers, data scientists and HSMA alumni to undertake a project that applies their new skills to address an operational problem in their organisation. HSMA projects have led to transformational improvements to service delivery and the establishment of new modelling and data science teams. Associates have permanent access to the HSMA community beyond the programme to collaborate and seek advice on further project work.

### Open Science Foundations

#### STARS

Simulation models play a vital role in health and medical research, aiding in predicting drug effectiveness and managing operational flow. However, challenges exist in sharing and reusing these models, hindering transparency and reproducibility. To address this, a framework called STARS is being developed to enhance the sharing of simulation models using Python and R. The project aims to identify barriers, create interactive training materials, and engage with the health data science community. By partnering with various organizations and journals, the initiative seeks to promote open science principles and improve model reproducibility.  The goal is to improve the way researchers share models within 2-5 years, fostering transparency and confidence in healthcare decision-making, ultimately benefiting patients.

#### OPTIMIST (OPTimising IMplementation of Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy)

Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability, with about 1 in 10 patients eligible for emergency thrombectomy, which removes blood clots blocking brain arteries. In England, 24 specialized centres offer this procedure, but most patients first go to local stroke units where clot-busting drugs are given. Thrombectomy is more effective for large artery blockages. Transporting suitable patients to specialized centres delays treatment by 90 minutes. The OPTIMIST project aims to streamline this process by developing methods for ambulance staff to identify patients who benefit most from direct transport to thrombectomy centre. It involves a clinical trial and modelling to assess patient outcomes and the impact on local stroke services.

#### MUSTER (Modelling mobile stroke Units for Stroke Treatment Equity and Resources)

Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs) offer an innovative approach to emergency stroke care, delivering treatment in the community rather than hospitals. International research demonstrates their effectiveness in improving patient outcomes and increasing treatment accessibility. In 2022, the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) strongly endorsed MSUs. While MSUs typically incur setup costs of around Â£1 million and daily running expenses, their integration into the National Health Service lacks clear guidance. Our study aims to provide policymakers with robust computer models of MSUs, assessing resource needs, patient benefits, cost-effectiveness, and implications for treatment disparities based on geography and population density. Through this research, we aim to inform local and national policies regarding the deployment of MSUs in the British healthcare system.
