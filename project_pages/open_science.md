# Open Science Foundations

## STARS

Simulation models play a vital role in health and medical research, aiding in predicting drug effectiveness and managing operational flow. However, challenges exist in sharing and reusing these models, hindering transparency and reproducibility. To address this, a framework called STARS is being developed to enhance the sharing of simulation models using Python and R.

The project aims to identify barriers, create interactive training materials, and engage with the health data science community. By partnering with various organizations and journals, the initiative seeks to promote open science principles and improve model reproducibility.  The goal is to improve the way researchers share models within 2-5 years, fostering transparency and confidence in healthcare decision-making, ultimately benefiting patients.
