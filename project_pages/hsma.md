# HSMA

The Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme is a training and mentoring programme that supports staff working in health, social care and policing organisations in England to learn and apply practical skills in operational modelling and data science. Staff are released from their usual role for a day a week for 15 months. They receive six months of training in open modelling and data science skills, as well as training in programming in Python from first principles. They are then supported by a community of HSMA trainers, researchers, data scientists and HSMA alumni to undertake a project that applies their new skills to address an operational problem in their organisation. HSMA projects have led to transformational improvements to service delivery and the establishment of new modelling and data science teams. Associates have permanent access to the HSMA community beyond the programme to collaborate and seek advice on further project work.
